Study guide tailored to help you strengthen your foundational software development knowledge, explaining what to study, why, and how:

---

### **1. Source Code Management (Git)**
#### **Why**
Version control is essential for collaboration and managing changes in codebases. Understanding Git empowers you to lead teams better and participate in technical discussions.
#### **What to Learn**
- Basics of Git: repositories, commits, branches, merging.
- Using Git tools like GitHub or GitLab.
- Handling conflicts and reviewing pull requests.
#### **How**
- Hands-on tutorials like [Git for Beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).
- Practice with simple projects: create a repo, make branches, merge them.

---

### **2. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
#### **Why**
Understanding the stages of software development (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment) helps you communicate effectively with teams.
#### **What to Learn**
- Agile methodology, Scrum, and Kanban.
- Software delivery pipelines.
#### **How**
- Read beginner-friendly articles or books on SDLC.
- Explore Agile and Scrum through short courses or resources on platforms like Scrum.org or Atlassian.

---

### **3. Testing and QA Fundamentals**
#### **Why**
Testing ensures quality. As a PM, knowing the types and importance of testing builds trust with technical teams.
#### **What to Learn**
- Types: Unit, Integration, System, Regression, and Acceptance testing.
- Automation basics (e.g., Selenium, Jest).
#### **How**
- Watch tutorials or take beginner courses on software testing.
- Explore open-source testing projects for practice.

---

### **4. Servers and Linux Basics**
#### **Why**
Deployment and debugging often require working with servers, and Linux is widely used. Understanding this improves your grasp of the development environment.
#### **What to Learn**
- Basic Linux commands.
- Setting up and deploying a simple web server (e.g., Nginx).
#### **How**
- Use free resources like [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com).
- Practice in a virtual environment (e.g., VirtualBox with Ubuntu).

---

### **5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
#### **Why**
CI/CD ensures smoother software delivery. Knowing it helps you plan timelines and address blockers effectively.
#### **What to Learn**
- What CI/CD is and its benefits.
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
#### **How**
- Follow practical tutorials on setting up pipelines.
- Use free tools like GitHub Actions on small projects.

---

### **6. Backend Basics**
#### **Why**
Understanding backend concepts bridges gaps in you knowledge of full-stack systems.
#### **What to Learn**
- What a server does.
- REST APIs and database interactions (CRUD).
#### **How**
- Build a simple API using Node.js or Python Flask.
- Use platforms like FreeCodeCamp or Codecademy for tutorials.

---

### **7. Deployment Fundamentals**
#### **Why**
To understand how code moves from development to production, enabling you to plan effectively.
#### **What to Learn**
- Deployment processes (manual and automated).
- Introduction to Docker for containerization.
#### **How**
- Set up a basic deployment on platforms like Heroku.
- Watch Docker tutorials for beginners.

---

### **8. Monitoring and Logging**
#### **Why**
Monitoring ensures application performance and reliability, vital for incident management.
#### **What to Learn**
- Basics of monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- Logging frameworks and practices.
#### **How**
- Set up a basic monitoring tool for a sample project.
- Explore YouTube tutorials on Prometheus and Grafana.

---

### **9. Real-World Scenarios and Practices**
#### **Why**
Practical experience consolidates theoretical knowledge.
#### **What to Learn**
- Simulate real-world projects with simple requirements.
- Collaborate with teams using Git, CI/CD, and deployment tools.
#### **How**
- Join open-source projects on GitHub.
- Practice by managing small self-made projects end-to-end.

---

**Tips for Success:**
- Dedicate regular, small time blocks to study and practice.
- Combine learning with hands-on projects.
- Take feedback from developer friends or mentors to improve.
